<p>
Apart from getting information using queries in a synchronous way (as illustrated in the &ldquo;How to update and query context information&rdquo; section above), Context Consumers can also get context information in an asynchronous way using notifications. In this scenario, the Context Broker GE is &ldquo;programmed&rdquo; to send notifications upon given conditions (specified in the subscription request).
</p>

<p>
In the case of NiceEating, the application backend could use a subscription so each time a new rating is cast by any user, the backend gets notified (in order to recalculate restaurant average score and publish it back in the Context Broker GE).
</p>

<div class="dev">
<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>POST &lt;cb_host&gt;:&lt;cb_port&gt;/v1/subscribeContext
{
    &quot;entities&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Rating&quot;,
            &quot;isPattern&quot;: &quot;true&quot;,
            &quot;id&quot;: &quot;.*&quot;
        }
    ],
    &quot;attributes&quot;: [ "score"  ],
    &quot;reference&quot;: &quot;http://backend.niceeating.foo.com:1028/ratings&quot;,
    &quot;duration&quot;: &quot;P1M&quot;,
    &quot;notifyConditions&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;ONCHANGE&quot;,
            &quot;condValues&quot;: [
                &quot;score&quot;
            ]
        }
    ]
}</code>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Another case would be an application that subscribes to changes in average ratings of a given restaurant. This may be useful for restaurant owners in other to know how their restaurants score is evolving.
</p>

<div class="dev">
<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>POST &lt;cb_host&gt;:&lt;cb_port&gt;/v1/subscribeContext
{
    &quot;entities&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Restaurant&quot;,
            &quot;isPattern&quot;: &quot;true&quot;,
            &quot;id&quot;: &quot;.*&quot;
        }
    ],
    &quot;attributes&quot;: [ "average_scoring"  ],
    &quot;reference&quot;: &quot;http://myapp.foo.com:1028/restaurant_average_scorings&quot;,
    &quot;duration&quot;: &quot;P1M&quot;,
    &quot;notifyConditions&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;ONCHANGE&quot;,
            &quot;condValues&quot;: [
                &quot;average_scoring&quot;
            ]
        }
    ]
}</code>
</pre>
</div>
