<p>
This section explains how users (both end users and developers) can publish data in CKAN, the Open Data publication GE, as well as how they can publish offerings containing this data in WStore so as to set access control policies over it and/or monetize it. You should note that at the time of writing this document, FIWARE offers two different types of data: context information and datasets. Each type of data should be published in a different way and for this reason you&rsquo;ll find two differentiated sections. A third section is devoted to explain the benefits of publishing your data in the WStore and the way of doing it.
