<span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">Xflow, which is part of xml3d.js, can not only be used to modify 3D scenes based for example on vertex data. It can also be employed to perform image processing computations, both on pixel data of static images and on data of video streams.</span>

The latter builds the foundation for marker tracking in Augmented Reality (AR) applications.

Like for the 3D scene examples, a set of examples for image processing is deployed with your instance of the 3D-UI-XML3D GE right away. This includes example applications that overlay a video stream with an XML3D object. For the application, it makes no difference whether the image data comes from a pre-computed video, or from an actual webcam video stream.

The use-case of Xflow for marker tracking in video streams is implemented in the Augmented Reality Generic Enabler. This Generic Enabler provides a simple interface to define markers that should be tracked and to change camera or object transformations based on a tracked marker in the scene.
