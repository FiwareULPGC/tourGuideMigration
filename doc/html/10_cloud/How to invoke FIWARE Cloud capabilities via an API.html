All the FIWARE Cloud capabilities outlined above can be invoked via OpenStack APIs, with unique extensions currently available only in FIWARE. A typical interaction would start by authenticating against the Identity Management GE, and getting a token that can be used in consequent calls to the individual services. For standard OpenStack APIs, one can use an existing client library - one of the <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/SDKs">many maintained in the open source community</a>.
