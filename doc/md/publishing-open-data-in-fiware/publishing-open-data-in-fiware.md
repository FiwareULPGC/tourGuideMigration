This section explains how users (both end users and developers) can
publish data in CKAN, the Open Data publication GE, as well as how they
can publish offerings containing this data in WStore so as to set access
control policies over it and/or monetize it. You should note that at the
time of writing this document, FIWARE offers two different types of
data: context information and datasets. Each type of data should be
published in a different way and for this reason youâ€™ll find two
differentiated sections. A third section is devoted to explain the
benefits of publishing your data in the WStore and the way of doing it.
