<span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">A set of example
applications is deployed with your instance of XML3D when you setup your
instance of XML3D via the FI-Lab recipe. The same set of example is also
available online in the xml3d-examples github repository:</span>

Setting up a 3D scene with XML3D is simple. All you need is a web server
to which the website can be deployed. If you install the
3D-UI-XML3D-GEri directly from the recipe, an instance of an Apache2
server is already deployed.

To enable XML3D in your website, just add a link to the xml3d.js script
file to your website’s HTML.

A detailed tutorial of how to set up 3D scenes is given in the XML3D
eLearning courses and the 3D-UI-XML3D-GEi User and Programmer’s guide.
