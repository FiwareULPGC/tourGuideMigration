You can define custom roles for your applications via the IdM interface,
then permissions for each role.

you define new role permissions, the IdM commits the resulting access
control policy to the FIWARE Access Control GE. From now on, for every
access request, the FIWARE Proxy protecting your application requests an
authorization decision (XACML) to the IdM GE which forwards it with
extra user info to the Access Control GE. The Access Control GE replies
with Permit or Deny Decision (XACML) to the IdM GE which in turn
forwards the decision to the Proxy. The Proxy blocks the application
request if and only if the decision is Deny.
