When progressing from small experimental environments to a more extensive use of the cloud infrastructure, it is often required to automate the provisioning and life cycle of complex applications comprising multiple resources -- such as multi-tier applications with several inter-dependent Virtual Machines, each running a particular software stack and configured to interact with the other Virtual Machines. FIWARE Cloud provides advanced capabilities to manage application <strong>blueprints</strong>, comprising one or more application tiers. Each tier may consist of an elastic group of Virtual Machine instances, with auto-scaling rules (enforced by the <strong>Policy Manager GE</strong>) that determine when Virtual Machines will be added or removed to/from the group, typically based on the load on the corresponding tier (monitored via a dedicated instrumentation provided by the <strong>Monitoring GE</strong>). Moreover, each tier can define the <strong>software packages</strong> that should be configured within the guest Operating System as part of the Virtual Machine instance provisioning. The software packages and their configuration are managed by the <strong>Software Deployment and Configuration GE</strong>, which is based on (and compatible with) Opscode Chef -- a widely used open source software configuration management tool. The combination of these GEs, surfaced in a holistic manner via the<strong> PaaS Management GE</strong> (and available in the FIWARE Cloud Portal), provides unique value proposition currently not available in other OpenStack-based clouds. It is worth noticing that the FIWARE team is working with the OpenStack community to contribute the necessary enhancements to make our technology broadly available.
