In order to implement this flow you can use an OAuth2 library.
[Here](http://oauth.net/2/)you will find implementations for PHP, Cocoa,
iOS, Java, Ruby, Javascript, Python … We have developed a Node.js
[example](https://github.com/ging/fi-ware-pep-proxy)that you can
download and test following these instructions:

1. Software requirements:  
 nodejs  
 npm

2. Install the dependencies:  
 npm install

3. Configure OAuth2 credentials (ClientID and Client Secret) in
config.js file. You will find them in your IDM account:
