The wiring editor allows you to easily connect widgets in a mashup to create a fully-fledged dashboard with RIA functionality. These widgets can be visually connected in the wiring editor to the back-end services or data sources through an extendable set of operators, including filters, aggregators, adapters, etc.

The wiring editor comes with a recommendation system for connections that help you to identify compatible endpoints that could be connected.
